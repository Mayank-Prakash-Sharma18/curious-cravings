## What is our main mission?

We aim to provide a healthy platform where people may open up their minds and discuss topics that we seldom think about in our day to day lives. Be it Philosophy, Psychology, Meditation, Yog, Science, Motivation, Values, Ethics or our experiences in general. 

We believe that everything is relative! Nothing is absolute, except GOD, maybe. 

So, we should analyze any topic with critical reasoning, in an unbiased manner. Rather than impose our pre-acquired believes and consuming everything with that prism. 

Everything Good, Bad, and Ugly is in our mind. Once we change our vantage point, our perspective changes. If we can open up our mind to these various perspectives, many of the problems plaguing our society and worrying our minds will resolve on their own.  

Keep reading, Keep thinking, Keep exploring, Keep experiencing!

Regards

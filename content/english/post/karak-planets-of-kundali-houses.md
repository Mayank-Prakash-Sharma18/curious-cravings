Each of the 12 houses of a kundali is governed by a zodiac sign, and each zodiac sign is governed by a planet. So, each house of a kundali has an owner planet. And, owner planets of the various houses of a kundali may vary from one person to another. 

However, each house of a kundali also has some Karak planets attached with it, which is/are the same for all the people. So, the effects related to a particular house will not only be influenced by the owner planet of that house, the planets sitting in that house, and the planets laying their sight on that house, but also the karak planet(s) of that house. 

We will study about them in this article.

## How to find if a Karak Planet is good or bad for us?

Well, to analyze the effect of any planet on us, we need to find out whether it’s beneficial or harmful for us. And then we need to find out how powerful that planet is. 

So, we will look for the following factors:
* Whether a karak planet is beneficial (yogkarak) or harmful (marak) in our kundali.
* Whether it’s in exalted (uchcha) state or debilitated (neech) state in our kundali.
* Whether a karak planet is in one of the three bad houses (i.e. 6, 8, 12), i.e. in trik-bhav. 
* What is the degree of the karak planet – it decides the power of the planet. 
* Whether a karak planet has been eclipsed – it reduces the power of the planet. 


## Winding Up

So, now we know that each house of a kundali has some fixed karak planets attached with it. So, we need to take them into account too. 

Moreover, there are some karak planets attached with particular events of our life too, e.g. Rahu and Mars are related to accidents in our life, Moon is related to our mind/mood, Sun is related to our will-power, etc. We will study about karak planets related to these specific events in our life (or facets of our personality) in a separate article.

In this article, we are going to study the various aspects of a lagna kundali from the perspective of trading and investment in Share Market. 

We will learn about the various facets and points that we should keep in mind while studying a lagna kundali, to know whether a person will be successful in share market. And if he would be, then to what extent. We will also try to figure out the minor dimensions, that is whether you should invest in share market for long time, or should you do intra-day trading, or maybe even F&O (Futures/Options).

  <b>Note</b><br>

What holds true for share market, also holds true for other things like betting, lottery, etc. But we strongly recommend you not to go down that route. Share market, forex, commodity market, and even cryptocurrency to a certain extent are ok. Not betting and lottery. That’s one of the most basic teachings of Mahabharat. 

Even in case of share market, do a proper risk-benefit analysis. Set attainable targets and always trade with a proper stop loss.

## Will I earn if I invest in Stock Market?

Well, it will depend a lot on the dhan/money yog in your kundali. The better it is, the more you may earn. Some guys make losses, some make minor gains, and some become millionaires. 

But what things should I keep in mind while reading a kundali to know all this?

### Fifth House Lord

The main house responsible for profits/losses in share market is the fifth house. Fifth house represents our wisdom – something that is of utmost importance in share market – when to put money, when to book profit/loss, etc. 

So, the first thing you should do is to find out the zodiac sign (rashi) in the fifth house and the owner/lord planet of that zodiac sign. For example, consider the following lagna kundali:
<img src="../../images/post/lagna-kundali-29.png" alt="Lagna Kundali" style="width:99%;height:99%;"> <br>

In the above lagna kundali, number 8 is written in the fifth house. 8 stands for Scorpio Zodiac sign, which is owned by Mars. 
* If the owner of the fifth house is sitting in the same house (i.e. Swagrahi), then it will increase your chances of making profit in share market (which is not the case in the above kundali, as Mars is sitting in the first house, not fifth). 
* If the owner of the fifth house is in an exalted state in the kundali, even than it will improve your luck in the share market. But Mars is not in an exalted state (ucch) in the above kundali. Rather, as it is sitting in the 4th zodiac sign (i.e. Cancer), it is in debilitated state (neech). So, such a person will probably make more losses in share market than book profits. 

### Moon

Moon also controls our mind/mood (mann). So, for you to be successful in share market, your Moon should also be good. 

Moon will be weak, or in a bad state if:
* Moon is in one of these houses – 6, 8 or 12.
* Moon is in debilitated state in the kundali. 
* Moon is eclipsed by the Sun (Amavasya Dosh)
* Moon is under the influence of cruel, demon planets, i.e. Saturn, Rahu, or Ketu. 
* Moon is very weak – its degree is 0-2 or 28-30. 

If this is the case, you should avoid investing in share market. 

For example, in the above kundali, Moon has a degree of 28. So, this kundali has a weak moon. Also, Moon is sitting in the 8th zodiac sign (i.e. Scorpio), and so is in debilitated state. This makes it even worse. (Though as Moon and Mars are sitting in each other’s houses, this will eliminate most of the bad effects of both these planets.)

### Mercury

Mercury is the karak planet of share market, as it is related to wisdom (buddhi). So, its position is also important in a given kundali. 

In the above kundali, even Mercury is weak, as its degree is 28. So, all in all such a person will find it very difficult to gain success in share market. 

You should get involved in Intra-day trading or F&O only if your Moon and Mercury are in good state and are strong. Otherwise, just restrict yourself to long-term investment, or just stay away from share market. 

For F&O, apart from a good fifth house lord, good Moon and Mercury, the lord of the second house must also be in a good position in your kundali. Second house in any kundali is the house of wealth (Dhan Bhav). If Jupiter (the guru planet) is laying its sight on the second house, then it’s even better. 

So, these are the major points that you need to consider before you think about trading or investing in share market.

Apart from these there are a few more minor points that you may consider:
* If any planet is laying its bad sight (neech drishti) on the fifth house, then it’s a negative point. For example, in the given kundali, Rahu is in an exalted state in the eleventh house, and it’s laying its sight on the fifth house. If any planet is in an exalted state in the eleventh house, then it lays a bad (neech) sight on the fifth house. So, this minor point makes it even worse for the person having this kundali. 
* If the owner/lord of the fifth house is sitting with Rahu or Ketu, then you may get sudden profits. That’s because, Rahu and Ketu are related to sudden profits. 
* If Rahu or Ketu are with Sun/Moon, then grahan dosh is formed, and this is not good for share market investment. For example, in the given kundali Ketu is sitting with Moon in the fifth house. Such people will mostly book losses in share market. 
* If Rahu or Ketu are with Jupiter, then chandaal dosh is formed, and this is not good for share market investment. For example, in the given kundali Ketu is sitting with Jupiter in the fifth house. Such people will most probbaly book losses in share market.
* You should have a look at the houses related to money, i.e. second house (related to wealth and savings), and eleventh house (related to income). If the lord of the fifth house is somehow positively related to the lord of second or eleventh houses, then such a person can invest for long-term (over 6 months) in share market. If Rahu and Ketu are also positively involved, then he may make even bigger profits in long-term. 

However, there are always some fine points and exceptions that may change the entire picture. Also, there may be some remedies available. 


## Remedies for bad planets related to share market

There are a few remedies available to us, even if we are not the most suited candidate for share market investment as per our kundali. 

For example, in the given kundali, the person has debilitated Mars and Moon. For this, he may worship Lord Shiva and Lord Hanuman. Also, to strengthen the power of Moon, he may wear pearl. (Though before wearing any stone you should see a lot of factors, preferably consult an expert.)

We may also recite the beej mantra of the concerned planet, or donate objects related to that planet. For example, if the owner of the fifth house is not in a good state, or a debilitated planet is sitting in the fifth house, or laying its sight on the fifth house, then we may recite its mantra or donate objects related to it. 

If you have grahan dosh or chandaal dosh in your kundali, then you may do some remedies for those too. 


## Where to Invest as per Kundali?

If we are well-suited to invest in share market, then the second question that arises is how to choose the companies, or the sectors that we should invest in?

Twelfth house of any lagan kundali is related to investment. So, the owner of the twelfth house and the planet sitting in that house will dictate your investments. If the planet sitting in the twelfth house is:
* Sun – invest in mutual funds, or in shares of pharmaceutical companies.
* Moon – invest in companies making glass or elements related to water. 
* Mars - invest in companies related to real estate, home construction, tea. Or, you may invest in property. 
* Mercury – invest in educational firms, banking.
* Jupiter - invest in companies related to grains and food. You may also invest in gold.
* Venus - invest in companies making sugar, rice, chemical products, cosmetic products, etc. You may also invest in film industry. 
* Saturn - invest in companies related to coal, iron, petroleum, leather. 

However, invest in the above areas only if the planet sitting in the twelfth house is good. It should not be in debilitated state. 

If no planet is sitting in the twelfth house, or the planet sitting in the twelfth house is not in a good state, then you should invest as per the lord/owner of the twelfth house.

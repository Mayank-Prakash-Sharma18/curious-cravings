Once upon a time an eaglet, i.e. a small eagle bird, got separated from its convocation. The group of Eagles flew away leaving behind this small eagle. Obviously, it was scared and confused. 

But luckily, a mother hen saw this eaglet and adopted it. She raised that eagle child as a part of her family, with other chickens.
 
Because the Eagle was being raised along with other chickens, it also started to behave like them. It used to eat like them, walk like them, and even fly like them. And we know that chickens do not fly very high. 

But one day this Eagle saw a convocation of Eagles flying high in the sky. It felt very exciting to him, and he became curious as to why he cannot fly so high. 

So, he asked the mother hen that, why can't we fly so high in the sky. At which the mother hen replied that they are eagles and we are chickens. We can never fly so high in the sky. 

The eagle accepted that, and then never tried to fly high, ever again in its life. 

Now, time for full disclosure. This story is absolutely untrue. It never happened! 

But still, what lessons can we draw from this hypothetical story?

## Lesson 1: Listen to your inner voice

This is what happens to many of us humans too. many of us fail to realise our own potential, because we never test ourselves enough. We do not take enough risks. Sometimes, we think that we are not good enough, because others think that we are not good enough. This is a travesty! 

We should not let anyone tell us that we cannot do something. Aim of human life is to identify, and then realize its full potential. And we should always encourage each other to do so.

## Lesson 2: Importance of Mentor

This story also highlights the importance of a good mentor or Guru in our life. A good mentor can identify our potential and motivate us to realise it. 

It can be your father, mother, wife, husband, brother, sister, or a friend of yours. If you have someone like that in your life, then you can thank your stars and consider yourself lucky.  

## Lesson 3: Life of Purpose versus A happy life

Well, all the above is true if one wants to live a life with some purpose. But, what if one just wants to lead a happy life? Is it necessary for the Eagle to fly, if he is absolutely happy the way he is!

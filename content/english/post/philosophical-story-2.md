It was the summer of 1992. A 11-year-old boy, Mayank had just moved in to a new city Bareilly with his parents. New school, new friends. 

Though being an introvert, this situation was not to his liking. He used to take time in making new friends. His father was posted as a Judge for 3 years in the city of Agra, before he got transferred to Bareilly. Mayank had made a few friends with some effort there. But out of a sudden all of that was gone. 

It had been around 2 months since Mayank started going to his new school, and he made a couple of friends Atul and Aziz. Little did he know that he had made a bad choice in friends. He will find out soon!

## Act I: Mayank Covets

Atul and Aziz were very extroverted kind of kids, with a lot of friends. Though it would be harsh to call them bullies, neither was Mayank anyone who will bear any ill-treatment. He was an introvert, but he had his self-esteem. Bullies can read that in a person. They know who can be bullied. So, this story is not about bullying. 

One day in school, Atul brought with him an electronic gadget, a calculator. He was showing it to his friends. Mayank looked at that piece of electronic and was instantly mesmerized. He had never seen a calculator before. Though he was from an affluent family, but it was 90s. Computers were just being introduced, there were no mobiles, and people used to own black-and-white TVs. 

The fact that Mayank was a little weak in Maths, may have fuelled his infatuation. A machine that can solve maths problems for him. How fascinating! It was a little magic box. It meant more to his 11-year-old self, than an Apple i-phone will mean to him later on in his adult life. It was something he had to have. Never before in his life he wanted something so bad. 

Though his parents were not one of those people who fulfil all demands of their kids and turn them into spoiled brats, who cannot have no for an answer. Many a times he will demand a toy or a comic, and his parents would try to get that for him. But he sure would be refused sometimes. And he was mature enough to understand that not all his desires can be fulfilled. And for some he would have to wait; he would have to be patient. 

However, this time it was different. His desires were getting the better of him. He talked to Atul regarding the calculator - where he got it from, how much did it cost? Atul told him that if he's interested, he can buy it from him for Rs. 200. It was a huge amount for a 11-year-old of 90s era.  

Mayank used to get Rs. 5 to 10 per day for lunch, which he used to buy patties during recess. He also used to get Rs. 100 as pocket money, that he used to give back to his mother for saving. So, Mayank had around Rs. 500-600 with him as pocket money savings at that time. But there was a big problem. What will he tell his mother? Why do he need Rs. 200 out of a sudden? 

Suddenly, keeping his own pocket money with his mother, started sounding like a dumb idea! 

Mayank's mother always taught her kids to reduce unnecessary expenditures. She will not like him spending Rs. 200 out of a sudden. He may not be denied, but sure some unpleasant looks will be given to him for some days. Enough to make him feel guilty; enough to drain the fun out of his new dream possession. But he wanted that calculator at any cost. A decision was made. He's going to steal his own pocket money! 

He had never stolen before, not even a penny. And the idea of stealing Rs. 200 felt like he's about to rob the national bank. But Mayank was a brave little kid, who used to accomplish his missions once he set them. That's how he was with his studies and sports too. A good student, and above average in sports. 

So, it was decided - the act will be carried out in the afternoon when dad will be out of home and mom taking her afternoon nap. With no one else at home, he slowly opened the storeroom's door. Climbed up to the slab where his pocket money was and got Rs. 200 out from there. Mission accomplished! Hope mom never finds out.

The next day he went to school with Rs. 200 in his pockets. It was the largest amount of money he had ever carried in his life on his own. He felt like Bill Gates! 

He talked with Atul, showed him the money and the deal was done. Atul and his friends were wide-eyed when they saw so much of money with Mayank. However, Atul told Mayank that he will give the calculator to him after the school ends. It was fine with Mayank. He had waited for many days for that calculator. He can wait for a few hours more. Only if the things were so simple in life!

During recess time, Mayank decided not to carry his money with him, as he was afraid that it may fell off from his pocket. So, he left the money in his school bag, and left the classroom to get his potato patties. But when he returned, and checked his bag, the money was gone. His face turned white! 

Someone has robbed him. So much money. Who could it be? Probably Atul or one of his friends. Only they saw the money with him. Only they knew I had brought money today to buy the calculator. Must be them. But what can be done now? 

Mayank confronted Atul, who only expressed his sympathies. He was ignorant of the act of theft. But was he genuine or just faking it? A thousand things went in the minds of Mayank. He could hardly concentrate in the class thereafter. How can he lose so much of his parents' hard-earned money? How? Why? 

And then he saw the calculator in Atul's bag. Atul used to sit just near him in the class. The calculator was just an arm's length away from Mayank's reach. It's probably Atul who stole his money and he must be taught a lesson. One thing that Mayank hated more than losing money was being taken for a ride. Atul and his friends must be laughing at him in their heart. 

It was the penultimate period. The class full of students. How will Mayank do it before the school ends. Atul probably won't bring the calculator again to school. The only reason Atul brought the calculator today was because Mayank had talked to him the day before that he will buy it from him the next day. 

Then it struck Mayank. After the last period, before the school gets over, they used to do a prayer for 2 minutes with hands folded in namaste pose and eyes closed. That's the only narrow window when Mayank can extend his hands and pull out the calculator from Atul's bag. 

The time came. All students rose up and closed their eyes. The prayer started. Mayank's heart was pounding out of his heart. He had never done anything like this before. Not even close! 

Was he doing it to get back at Atul, or was he blinded by the desire to get that calculator at any cost? Probably both. But it was not the time to think. It was a time to act. And that he did. Mayank opened his eyes, looked around and in a flash the deed was done. 

  On his way home, Mayank felt mixed emotions - he was relieved to not get caught doing two thefts in a couple of days, a feeling of triumph at getting back at the bullies, giving them a taste of their own medicine, but also an unknown fear. 

The next day, when he went to school, all hell broke loose. 


## Act II: Mayank decides to die

Atul had reported the theft of the calculator to the class teacher. Though he had not seen the act, but he had doubts on Mayank. On the other hand, Mayank thought he did the right thing, by committing an act of theft, in retaliation of another similar act. 

So, he stood his ground and denied any allegation put on him by Atul. The class teacher interrogated Mayank, but he kept on denying that he took the calculator. Though it all was very traumatizing for a student like Mayank, who was very studious and was rarely punished or scolded by teachers or his parents. 

Somehow the day ended, and Mayank came home. What a bad day! 

And it was probably about to get much worse. That weekend a parents-teacher meeting was scheduled!

The 3-4 day long wait till the day of the parents-teacher meeting was unbearable. Mayank lost his appetite, found it hard to sleep or study. He was certain that the class teacher will tell about the theft incident to his parents. The embarrassment! 

And for the first time in his life, he thought of ending his life. Such a dark thought, in such a small child. But it happened, and looked better than facing further embarrassment. Mayank decided that if the teacher will report about the incident to his parents, then rather than facing their fury and feeling extreme shame, he will jump of the first-floor balcony. (Though it would only have hurt him, but that was the plan of a child.)

The D-day came. His parents left for school. Mayank waited and prayed to God! Any little noise near the main gate, and his heart will start ponding. He can feel it coming out of his chest. 

By now the class teacher must have told my parents! <br>
How embarrassed they must be feeling! <br>
How furious they will be! <br>
It's almost an hour; they must be coming back anytime now! <br>
Time to die! Oh man! It will hurt! <br>
But I cannot face my parents! 

Then the moment came. The parents rang the doorbell. Mayank opened the door, with one eye on the balcony. 

They were smiling and laughing!!! What???

He tried to notice any sign of anger, hate or anguish, but there was none. Probably the teacher never met my parents. Probbaly she forgot to mention the incident. Don't know. After many days, Mayank felt a deep sense of relief. 

But, what if she asks me to bring my parents again to school the next day? Suddenly, the heart began sinking again. The ambiance turned dark. It all started looking gloomy again. 

But the next day in school was also uneventful. Nothing happened. And so was the next day, and the day after. 

It was a miracle! 


## Act III: The Enlightenment!

Mayank had hidden his prized possession at the terrace, under the leaves below the water tank. That's where he used to go to enjoy some calculations, using his magic machine. 

He even shared his little dirty secret with his sister and some of his locality friends. Though he never told them, how he got that calculator. But he wanted to show off!

But soon he started losing interest in it. It started to feel more like a burden. The fear of getting caught!

What will he tell his parents? How he managed to get hand on such an expensive piece of electronics?

He started to lose sleep again. Lost his appetite. The most precious possession now felt as the most cursed. 

Soon a decision was made. 

He will have to get rid of the calculator, destroy it!

He went up on the terrace, played with his calculator for the last time and then flung it far on the road that ran behind his house. That road was inside the circuit house of the city. 

Mayank saw his beloved, prized possession strike the hard road and break into pieces. But at that moment he did not feel sad, he felt freedom, he felt happiness of the highest order. 

That day he learnt that no worldly possession can bestow upon him the happiness he seeks. No worldly possession is worth losing a good night's sleep, and one's self-respect.

That day he learnt that things gained from hard work taste sweeter than those gained by ill means. That day he decided not to go on the wrong path again. Not to covet things unnecessarily. Rather earn with hard work and live with a clear conscience. 

That calculator taught him the calculation of life! 

Sum total of so many life lessons, learned so early. Not a bad experience at the end of the day after all. 

Can you guys tell some lessons that we can learn from this story? Would you have done something different than what Mayank did? We will like to hear it all in the comment section below.

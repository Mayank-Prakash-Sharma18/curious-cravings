In astrology, people wear various gems to strengthen their favourable planets. Different gems are related to different planets in kundali. Which gem you should wear and when will depend on your kundali. 

However, in this article we are not going to talk about that. Rather the focus of this article will be to inform you how to do it the right way. Even if you know what gem you should wear, you may wear it the wrong way and do more harm than good.

  <b>Note</b><br>

Our intention here is not to scientifically prove that Astrology or the theory of gems affecting our planets is correct or incorrect. Though it’s an interesting area of study and we wish to do so in near future. 

However, our intention is to provide you correct information regarding this school of thought. If you believe in Astrology and Gems then at least do it the right way.

## What things should we keep in mind while wearing a gem?

Once an astrologer, or you yourself, gets to know the gem that you should wear for better results, it is only half the work done. It’s like knowing which medicine to take for your disease. 

You must also know when, how frequently, and in what amount that medicine has to be taken. Similarly, in case of gems you should also know:
* What should be the size and carat of the gem?
* Whether the gem is genuine or not?
* In which finger should we wear a particular gem?
* With what metal base should we wear a particular gem?

We intend to answer a few of these questions in this article. 


## In which finger should we wear a gemstone?

Before we start talking about fingers, let’s get one thing straight. Men and Boys are supposed to wear gems in right hand. While Women and Girls are supposed to wear them in left hand. This is true for any gem.

Now, let’s move on to the fingers.

Some planets have been assigned specific places on our hands in palm reading. You can see that in the figure given below. 
<img src="../../images/post/gemstones-1.png" alt="Gemstones" style="width:99%;height:99%;"> <br>

Various gemstones are related to different planets. We should wear gems as per that. Let’s see a few examples. 
* Yellow sapphire (pukhraj) is related to Jupiter (गुरु), and so it should be worn in index finger (तर्जनी उंगली). Generally, we wear no other gem in this finger. 
* Blue sapphire (neelam) is related to Saturn (शनि), and so it should be worn in middle finger (मध्यमा). As Saturn is a friend of Venus (शुक्र), we also wear Opal (dudhiya patthar) in this finger. 
* Ruby (manik) is related to Sun (सूर्य), and so it should be worn in ring finger (अनामिका). Red coral (moonga) is related to Mars (मंगल), and Sun is a friend of Mars. So, Red coral should also be worn in ring finger (अनामिका).
* Emerald (panna) is related to Mercury (बुद्ध), and so it should be worn in	little finger (कनिष्ठा). Pearl (moti) is related to Moon (चंद्र) and we also wear it in this finger. 

All this has also been depicted in the following figure:

<div class="toc-mak">

  <b>Some Exceptions</b><br>

People also wear diamond and White sapphire (safed pukhraj) for Venus. But Opal is considered the best. 

We can also wear pearl in the ring finger, if Sun is unfavourable (marak) planet in your kundali and Moon is a favourable (yogkarak) planet. Here pearl has a pacifying affect on the Sun. 

In some cases, we also wear opal (for Venus) in the index finger, when blue sapphire (for Saturn) has also been recommended for us. 
</div>

<div class="toc-mak">
  <img src="../../../images/pencil.png">
  <b>Note</b><br>

We must wear gemstones on our fingers in a ring. So that sunrays may fall on them. That’s why it’s not recommended to wear gemstones in pendants. 
</div>

Now, let’s see what metal base should we use for these gems. 


## What should be the metal base for a gem?

* Yellow sapphire (pukhraj) should always be embedded in a gold ring. 
* Blue sapphire (neelam) should always be embedded in a mix-metal (panch dhatu) ring or a brass (peetal) ring. Do not use gold or silver ring for this gem stone. 
* Opal (dudhiya patthar) should always be embedded in a silver ring. 
* Ruby (manik) should always be embedded in a gold ring, mix-metal (panch dhatu) ring or a brass (peetal) ring.
* Red coral (moonga) should always be embedded in a gold ring, mix-metal (panch dhatu) ring or a brass (peetal) ring.
* Emerald (panna) should always be embedded in a silver ring.
* Pearl (moti) should always be embedded in a silver ring.

  <b>Note</b><br>

We can wear Hessonite Garnet Stone (Gomed) gem for Rahu, and Cat's eye (lehsunia or vaidurya) gem for Ketu. 

But some astrologers suggest that we should not wear stones for these planets. That’s because Rahu may make a person involved in some anti-social activities, such as gambling, drinking, etc. And Ketu may push him/her towards spirituality, away from social activities. 

Both will take a person away from normal family life.

## When should we wear a gemstone?

Before wearing a gemstone one should wash it with raw milk and then ganga water. Thereafter read the mantra of the concerned god, and only then wear that gemstone. 

But there are some rules regarding the appropriate time of wearing gemstones. Let’s see them. 

We should start wearing some gemstones during the ascending phase (Sukla Paksha) of the moon, i.e. when moon’s brightness increases from new moon (amavasya) to full moon (poornima). And some during the descending phase (Krishna Paksha) of the moon, i.e. when moon’s brightness reduces from full moon to new moon. 

* We should start wearing the following gemstones during ascending phase (Sukla Paksha) of the moon: Gemstones of Sun, Moon, Jupiter, Mars, and Venus, i.e. Ruby (manik), Red coral (moonga), Yellow sapphire (pukhraj), Pearl (moti) and Opal.
* We should start wearing the following gemstone during descending phase (Krishna Paksha) of the moon: Blue sapphire (neelam) for Saturn. This is the only gemstone that we should start wearing during the descending phase of the moon. 

We should wear the gemstone of a planet on the day of that planet. For example, wear gemstone of Sun on Sunday, wear gemstone of Moon on Monday, wear gemstone of Mars on Tuesday, wear gemstone of Mercury on Wednesday, wear gemstone of Jupiter on Thursday, wear gemstone of Venus on Friday, and wear gemstone of Saturn on Saturday. 

We should wear them within 1 hour of the sunrise.

  <b>Some FAQs related to gemstones</b><br>

### Can we wear gemstone in Krishna Paksha?

Yes, we can wear gemstones all the year round. It will depend on your kundali too. 

However, we should not start wearing them during the Krishna Paksha. We only start wearing Blue sapphire (neelam) during Krishna Paksha; no other gem. 

### Can we wear gemstone while sleeping?

Yes, we can wear gemstones while sleeping too. In fact, when we start wearing gemstones, we perform some rituals. So, we should not remove them now and then. Their removal also involves some rituals. 

### Can we wear gemstone during periods? 

Yes, it’s perfectly alright to wear gemstones during periods. In fact, once you start wearing gemstones, you should not take them out now and then. Be consistent with them to see their effects.

## Which gems should not be worn together?

There are some gems that we should not wear together. To understand this concept, we should know that there are two categories of planets – god planets and demon planets. 

* God Planets – Sun, Moon, Jupiter, Mars
* Demon Planets – Saturn, Venus, Rahu, Ketu

God planets are friends with each other. Similarly, demon planets are friends with each other. However, god planets and demon planets are each other’s enemies. 

Mercury planet is friendly with all planets except Moon and Mars. 

We should never wear gemstone of enemy planets at the same time. For example, if you are wearing Blue sapphire (neelam) for Saturn, which is a demon planet, then you should not wear a gem for any god planet such as Sun, Moon, etc. So, you cannot wear Yellow sapphire (pukhraj), Ruby (manik), Red coral (moonga), or Pearl (moti).

However, if you have been recommended gemstones of enemy planets, then wear the gemstone of the planet whose mahadasha is on. For example, if you have been recommended to wear Blue sapphire (neelam) and Yellow sapphire (pukhraj), then you can wear Blue sapphire when mahadasha of Saturn is on, and wear Yellow sapphire when mahadasha of Jupiter is on. Do not wear them together. 


## What should be the weight of the Gemstone? 

Try to get original gemstones. For this purpose, you should buy gemstones that have been certified by the government or some credible agency. That is, always buy gemstones along with purity certificate. 
The weight of the gemstone should be in proportion to your body weight. In case of a pure gemstone, its weight (in ratti) should be a little more than one-tenth of your body weight. 

For example, if you are 70 kgs, then you should wear 7.25 ratti gemstone. If you are 90 kgs, then you should wear 9.25 ratti gemstone. 

<div class="toc-mak">
  <img src="../../../images/pencil.png">
  <b>Note</b><br>

1 Ratti is around 0.91 Carat (approximately) 
</div>

However, if you cannot find a gemstone of good quality, i.e. there are some impurities in it, then to be on the safer side we should wear heavier gemstones. For example, if you are 70 kgs, then you should wear 8.25 ratti gemstone. If you are 90 kgs, then you should wear 10.25 ratti gemstone.

We know that yoga is the science of uniting the soul with the divine. But do you know that there are many types of yoga?

In fact, in India, the sages and pandits who were well versed in yoga had understood that there is not one way of union with God, but there are many paths. Every person can choose his own path according to his personality and wishes. There was and still is spiritual freedom in India.

Therefore, over a period of time, yoga has been divided into many parts by the experts of this science. Many distinctions of yoga were made, and yoga practices were started under many names.

On the basis of different yoga scriptures, there are following types of yoga:
* Raj Yog
* Gyan Yog (Knowledge Yog)
* Karm Yog
* Bhakti Yog
* Hath yoga
* Kundalini Yog
* Sleep Yog (Neend Yog)
* Rhythm Yog (Lay Yog)
* Love Yog (Prem Yog)

## Raj Yoga

In short, 'Raj Yoga' is the science of yoga in which the yogi attains yogic siddhi by subduing his mind.

In Raj Yoga, there are eight parts of yoga â€“ Yama, Niyama, Asana, Pranayama, Pratyahara, Dharana, Dhyana and Samadhi.

After detailed discussion, these eight were further divided into sixteen parts. Dharana is divided into two parts - Prakriti Dharana and Brahma Dhyana, there are four parts of Samadhi - Vitaranugat, Vicharanugat, Anandanugat, and Asmitanugat.

After the spiritual practice of all these parts of this yoga, the state of mind becomes one in the final, 'samadhi'. The cessation of the mind is yoga. The mind is the bondage for man. The action of the intellect is very helpful in freeing it from this bondage. The process of cessation of the mind through thoughts is called 'Raj Yoga'.


## Gyan Yoga

It is knowledge that enables a man to practice yoga. It is not possible to attain yoga without knowledge, or to attain true knowledge without yoga.

Knowledge is of two types - 'prakar vishya' and 'prakar avishya'. When the first type of knowledge becomes firm, then the second type of knowledge arises. The second type of 'prakar avishya' knowledge is the knowledge of God.

Knowledge is also divided into 'Subtle knowledge (shukshma gyan)' and 'Materialistic knowledge (sthool gyan)'. Materialistic knowledge is physical knowledge which is also called science. This knowledge keeps man trapped in worldly entanglements. Subtle knowledge is spiritually essential and superior knowledge. Self-knowledge or God-related knowledge is included in this. This knowledge can elevate a man to a higher position/realm.

Such a seeker becomes one with God, he becomes imbued with the divine qualities. He comes to know God only through the realization of his soul. Such a seeker experiences non-duality. Then all the bonds are broken and salvation is certain. This is yoga of knowledge (gyan yog).


## Karma Yoga

Everyone has to work in this world. No one can live without doing karma. Now the question arises that how to act and how not to? What is good karma and what is bad karma (dushkarm)?

It should be decided by the law of the scriptures. It is duty and good karm to act according to the rules of the scriptures. Karm should never be done with the expectation of getting results or with desire. Do it with selflessness, without attachment to the end result. It is appropriate for a Sadhak or Karm Yogi to do whatever action he does, without desiring for its results, with full devotion and by offering it to God. The results can also be against the will of a person. Don't be discouraged even then, don't be worried. Be consistent in every situation. Always maintain mental balance. Be the same in happiness and sorrow. This is life sadhana and karma yoga.

The Gita and Mahabharata tell us enough about 'Karmayoga'. At one place in the Mahabharata, Janaka says - 'We run the state without attachment. Even if sandalwood is applied to our hand and the other one is peeled, we feel the same. That is, glory and hardship are the same for us. Happiness and sorrow are the same.'

This is the hallmark of a true Karma Yogi. The fruit of Karma Yoga sadhna is attained only when there are such pious feelings. When the seeker reaches such a state of mind in his life. This is the true karma.


## Bhakti Yoga

Whatever a devotee does with devotion, he dedicates it to God. The devotee's mind is always engrossed in the Lord. A devotee is no less than any other type of yogi. To have love for God, to surrender everything to Him is devotion.

One can attain salvation through devotion. The firmness of devotion unites the devotee and the Lord. This is what is called 'Ishvara Pranidhan'.

When the yogi of Bhakti Yoga has strengthened his devotion, then he becomes free from all his desires. Even he has no desire for salvation. He only wants God. He wants unity with him, wants to mingle with him. By the culmination of devotion, forgetting one's ego and getting colored in the color of God, becoming engrossed is Bhakti Yoga.

Both Bhakti of Saguna and bhakti of Nirguna are the different names of the feeling of oneness with Brahman or Ishvara. When a devotee achieves success in this, then he becomes a Bhakti Yogi.

Mirabai and Surdas were such virtuous devotees. Vaishnava saints like Ramanuja, Maghavacharya etc. were such devotees.


## Winding Up

Apart from these, there are many other yogas such as Hatha Yoga, Kundalini Yoga, Neend Yoga, Lay Yoga, Prem Yoga etc. There are so many different types of yoga that have been described.

But the goal of all Yogas is the same. Their purpose is also the same, i.e. oneness or union with God.

The seeker who practices any yoga with sincere heart, with full dedication and hard work, will get success in yoga. There are different kinds of siddhis (accomplishments) that you can attain through yog. But the learned yogis have forbidden to fall in the trap of siddhis or to remain entangled in them. The aim of any yog practice should only be mukti, or even better the desire to know the almighty and be one with Him.

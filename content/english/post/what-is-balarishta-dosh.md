## How is Balarishta Dosh formed?

The main root cause of this dosh is weak Moon, or bad state of Moon. It may be formed if:
* Moon is in one of these houses – 6, 8 or 12.
* Moon is in debilitated state in the kundali. 
* Moon is eclipsed by the Sun (Amavasya Dosh)
* Moon is under the influence of cruel, demon planets, i.e. Saturn, Rahu, or Ketu. 
* Moon is very weak – its degree is 0-1 or 29-30. 

Moon has been equated with mother in Astrology. So, if the mother of a child is weak, then it will surely adversely affect the child. Though Moon’s motherly nature is required by us throughout our life, but it is childhood when we need it the most. 


## Nature of Balarishta Dosh

Balarishta Dosh impacts the lives of young children. If it’s present in the kundali of a young child then it will adversely impact his/her life and may even shorten it. Sounds scary and pretty cruel, just like mother nature is sometimes! 

Moreover, Moon controls and affects our mind/mood/subconscious (mann). So, if Moon is weak in our kundali, we will not be able to concentrate on any thing for long. Such kids may suffer from attention deficiency, which may impact their learning capability. Such people may also suffer from anxiety, fear, and stress issues, sometimes due to real reasons and sometimes even due to imaginary/virtual causes.

  <b>Note</b><br>

We know that Moon changes the zodiac sign (rashi) in every 2.25 to 2.5 days. So, in a month the Moon covers all the 12 zodiac signs (rashi) of our kundali, which represent the various aspects of our life. That’s why the daily horoscopes depend a lot on the movement of the Moon. 

The house where the Moon is will attract our attention and will for those 2.25 - 2.5 days. So, we will concentrate on the things related to that house for that period – study, research, work, innovation, anything related to that house.

## Remedies of Balarishta Dosh

If your kid has Balarishta Dosh, then you should give special attention to him/her, especially in the early years. Do not leave them alone for long, or let them engage in dangerous activities. In a way, the real mother and father of such a child has to compensate the lack of motherly support, care, protection, and attention from the Moon. 

As Balarishta Dosh is often formed due to weak Moon, you may do certain things to energise and strengthen the Moon of your kid:
* You may recite the mool mantra of Moon, on behalf of the kid (as young kids cannot do that on their own).
* You may make him/her wear Moti, the gem of Moon. Wearing the gem of a planet strengthens that planet. (Do not do this if Moon is marak in the kundali.)
* You may worship Lord Shiv. 

There may be many more remedies available, which you may get to know if you consult a good astrologer. However, rather than doing n number of things, whatever you do, do it with full dedication. 

You may meditate a bit too. Meditation is something that connects us with the supreme power and is a much bigger science/art than Astrology.

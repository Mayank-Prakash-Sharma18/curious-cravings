## What is Neech Bhang Raj Yog ? 

There are various kinds of Raj Yogs that are formed in kundali. Neech Bhang Raj Yog is one of them. 
We have already studied that planets can be in various states in our kundali:
* Normal state
* Exalted state (Ucchh)
* Debilitated state (Neech)

If a planet is in debilitated state (Neech), it gives bad results. While, a planet in exalted state (Ucchh) gives good results. But if somehow the debilitated state of a planet is cancelled out, then it will no more be a bad planet for you. 

This is what Neech Bhang Raj Yog does. 

Its name is self-explanatory:
* Neech Bhang means that debilitated state of a planet has been cancelled out. 
* Raj Yog means that the planet in question will rather prove good for you, and will give favourable results.

Now, let’s dive into its details – some of its rules, examples, etc. 


## Neech Bhang Raj Yog Rules

First of all, find out how many planets in a given kundali are in debilitated state. We are just going to focus on these planets, and see whether their debilitated state is being cancelled out or not. 

To find out whether a kundlai has this Neech Bhang Raj Yog, you need to take into account the following dimensions, i.e. here are the parameters you need to check. 

### Owner of the House

If the owner of the zodiac sign (rashi) is sitting with a planet in debilitated state, then that planet will no more be in debilitated state. That is, Neech Bhang Raj Yog will be formed. 

There’s an easy way to remember it. A planet in debilitated state is like a villain, who intends to do bad things. However, if the owner of the house is staying in his own house, then that villain will not be able to do the bad deeds that it intended to do. 

Let’s take an example. Consider the following kundali.
<img src="../../images/post/lagna-kundali-17.png" alt="Lagna Kundali" style="width:99%;height:99%;"> <br>
In the above kundali, planet Sun is in the 5th house, which has Libra zodiac sign in it. We know that Sun is in debilitated state in Libra zodiac sign. However, the owner of Libra zodiac sign is Venus, and it is also sitting in the same house. So, Neech Bhang Raj Yog is there in the above kundali, and Sun will not give bad results. 

### Sight of the Owner of the House

The owner of the zodiac sign need not even sit in the concerned house. Even if it is laying its sight on that house where planet in debilitated state is present, then Neech Bhang Raj Yog will be formed.

There’s an easy way to remember it. A planet in debilitated state is like a villain, who intends to do bad things. However, if the owner of the house is looking at his house, then that villain will not be able to do the bad deeds that it intended to do. 

Let’s take an example. Consider the following kundali.
<img src="../../images/post/lagna-kundali-18.png" alt="Lagna Kundali" style="width:99%;height:99%;"> <br>
In the above kundali, planet Sun is in the 5th house, which has Libra zodiac sign in it. We know that Sun is in debilitated state in Libra zodiac sign. However, the owner of Libra zodiac sign is Venus, and it is sitting in the 11th house. We know that every planet lays its sight on the 7th house from where it is sitting. So, Venus sitting in 11th house will be looking at the 5th house. So, Neech Bhang Raj Yog is there in the above kundali, and Sun will not give bad results. 

### Exalted state planet in the House

If an exalted state planet is also sitting with the debilitated state planet, then Neech Bhang Raj Yog will be formed.

There’s an easy way to remember it. A planet in debilitated state is like a villain, who intends to do bad things, while an exalted state planet is like a hero. If a hero is present in the same house as that of a villain, then the villain will not be able to do any bad deeds. 

Let’s take an example. Consider the following kundali.
<img src="../../images/post/lagna-kundali-19.png" alt="Lagna Kundali" style="width:99%;height:99%;"> <br>
In the above kundali, planets Sun and Saturn are in the 5th house, which has Libra zodiac sign in it. We know that Sun is in debilitated state in Libra zodiac sign, while Saturn is in exalted state in Libra zodiac sign. So, Neech Bhang Raj Yog is there in the above kundali, and Sun will not give bad results.

Let’s take one more example. Consider the following kundali.
<img src="../../images/post/lagna-kundali-20.png" alt="Lagna Kundali" style="width:99%;height:99%;"> <br>
In the above kundali, planets Ketu and Moon are in the 5th house, which has Scorpio zodiac sign in it. We know that Moon is in debilitated state in Scorpio zodiac sign, while Ketu is in exalted state in Scorpio zodiac sign. So, Neech Bhang Raj Yog is there in the above kundali, and Moon will not give bad results. 

### Degree of the Planet

A planet in debilitated state will only be able to do bad deeds, if it has some power. However, if the debilitated state planet has very low degree (say from 0 to 2 degrees), or very high degree (say from 28 to 30 degrees), then it will almost be powerless and not give any bad results. 

Though we cannot say that Neech Bhang Raj Yog has been created here. But the debilitated planet will remain dormant anyways. 

However, if its degree is between 12 and 18, then it will give 100% of its intended bad results. 

### Whether sitting with the Sun and overpowered by it? 

If a planet is sitting with the Sun and it’s degree is close to the degree of Sun (within a range of 10-12 degrees), then that planet is said to be overpowered by the Sun. Just like we cannot see a planet in the background in the sky, if it gets close to the Sun. 

Let’s take one example. Consider the following kundali.
<img src="../../images/post/lagna-kundali-21.png" alt="Lagna Kundali" style="width:99%;height:99%;"> <br>
In the above kundali, planet Mars is in the 2nd house, which has Cancer zodiac sign in it. We know that Mars is in debilitated state in Cancer zodiac sign. Now, Sun is also sitting the same house. If degrees of Sun and Mars are less than 10-12 degrees apart, then Mars will be considered overpowered by the Sun. So, Mars will not be able to give its intended bad results in this kundali. 

Say, if degree of Sun is 19, and degree of Mars is 14 (difference of only 5). Or if degree of Sun is 21, and degree of Mars is 18 (difference of only 3).

We hope that the concept of Neech Bhang Raj Yog is clear to you now.

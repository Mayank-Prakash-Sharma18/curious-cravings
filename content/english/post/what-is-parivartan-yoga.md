  <b>Note</b><br>

We will be talking about lagna kundali in this article. Not any other kind of kundali, such as chandra kundali, etc.  

In previous articles, you were introduced to the basic rules of Lagna Kundali. If you haven't read that, you may start by reading <a href="../how-to-read-lagna-kundali" title="Basics of lagna kundali" class="mak-link">the basics of lagna kundali in this article.</a> 

That article also tells you how we count houses in a kundali - a knowledge you need to have to understand this article. However, we are also attaching below a snapshot of a blank kundali with its house numbers marked, just for your reference. House numbers remain the same for all North Indian kundalis.

## What is Zodiac Sign Reversal Yog (Rashi Parivartan Yog)?

If a planet A is sitting in the zodiac sign of planet B, and in turn planet B is sitting in the zodiac sign of planet A, then this situation is called Zodiac Sign Reversal Yog.

It is also called Rashi Parivartan Yog, or just Parivartan Yog. 


## Types of Parivartan Yog

Parivartan Yog are basically of three types:
* Maha Yog (महा योग) 
* Dainya Yog (दैन्य योग) 
* Khal Yog (खल योग) 

### What is Maha Yog (महा योग)?

It’s a Raj Yog. If you have this type of Parivartan Yog in your kundali, then you will get very good results.

This kind of Parivartan Yog is formed when two planets are sitting in each other’s houses, and
* both of them are in the central houses (i.e. houses 1, 4, 7, and 10), or 
* one of them is in a triangular house (i.e. houses 1, 5 and 9) and other in a central house.

  <b>Note</b><br>

Central houses and Triangular houses are considered good and auspicious houses in a kundali, as they are related to good aspects of our life. 
</div>

For example, in the kundali given below Jupiter is sitting in the first house that is occupied by Gemini zodiac sign (whose owner is Mercury). Mercury is sitting in the tenth house that is occupied by Pisces zodiac sign (whose owner is Jupiter).

So, Jupiter and Mercury are sitting in each other’s houses.  This forms Maha Yog. 

### What is Dainya Yog (दैन्य योग)?

If you find this kind of Yog in a kundali, then it will force even good planets to give bad results. That is, it will give bad results.

This kind of Parivartan Yog is formed when two planets are sitting in each other’s houses, and one of the houses is a good one, and the other a bad one. 

<div class="toc-mak">
  <img src="../../../images/pencil.png">
  <b>Note</b><br>

Houses 6, 8 and 12 are considered bad and inauspicious houses in a kundali, as they are related to bad aspects of our life. 
</div>

For example, in the kundali given below Saturn is sitting in the tenth house that is occupied by Pisces zodiac sign (whose owner is Jupiter).  Jupiter is sitting in the eighth house that is occupied by Capricorn zodiac sign (whose owner is Saturn). 
<img src="../../images/post/lagna-kundali-26.png" alt="Lagna Kundali" style="width:99%;height:99%;"> <br>

So, Jupiter and Saturn are sitting in each other’s houses. 8th house is a bad house, while 10th house is a good house. This forms Dainya Yog. 

### What is Khal Yog (खल योग)?

This Yog makes a person do a lot of hard work. This yog is related to the third house of the kundali. The third house of a kundali is related to a lot of hard work, long journeys, etc. That is, you will get results only after doing a lot of hard work. And even then, the results may not be as good as anticipated or deserved. 

So, if the owner of the third house is sitting in another house, and the owner of that house is sitting in third house, then this Parivartan Yog is called Khal Yog.

For example, in the kundali given below Mercury is sitting in the third house that is occupied by Leo zodiac sign (whose owner is Sun).  Sun is sitting in the fourth house that is occupied by Virgo zodiac sign (whose owner is Mercury). 
<img src="../../images/post/lagna-kundali-27.png" alt="Lagna Kundali" style="width:99%;height:99%;"> <br>

So, Mercury and Sun are sitting in each other’s houses. This forms Khal Yog. So, the concerned person will get results related to the third and fourth houses, but after a lot of effort and work. It’s not necessarily bad. Many people get pretty good results due to this yog.

  <b>Note</b><br>

As we saw above, Parivartan Yog can give positive, as well as negative results. Parivartan Yog is related to some particular houses only. But what about other houses? That is, when planets are sitting in each other's houses in general. 

In such case, we do not get bad results, even if the concerned planets are enemies. 

We know that, if a planet is sitting in the zodiac sign of its enemy planet, then it will do harm to that house of the kundali. However, if two enemy planets are sitting in each other’s zodiac signs, then they will not harm the house of each other. 

You may imagine it to be a situation, wherein one person is holding his enemy’s family member at gun point, while the other person is also doing the same. It’s a stalemate situation. Nobody will do any harm. 

For example, we know that Venus and Mars are enemy planets. However, if they are sitting in each other’s zodiac signs, then they will not do any harm. Say, if Venus is sitting in Scorpio zodiac sign (whose owner is Mars), and Mars is sitting in Libra zodiac sign (whose owner is Venus).

The word “Pitra” refers to our ancestors, especially those who died out of a sudden due to some accident, murder, or disease. They have unfulfilled worldly desires and so they lay their affect on their progenies. 

In this article, we are going to learn about Pitra Dosh – how it’s formed, its effects and how to reduce its ill-effects.

## Conditions for the formation of Pitra Dosh

Pitra Dosh is related to the 9th house of the kundali. This house is related to father and our ancestors. 

If in the 9th house of the kundali Sun is sitting with Saturn, Ketu, or Rahu, then Pitra Dosh is said to be formed. In other words, Pitra Dosh is formed when Sun is in conjunction with Saturn, Ketu, or Rahu. 
If these planets are in conjunction in any other house of a kundali, then we may say that there’s partial Pitra Dosh. 

Kindly note that, these planets must be sitting together in the same house for this dosh to form. Just laying sight on each other from different houses will not form this dosh.

  <b>Some Exceptions to the conditions for the formation of Pitra Dosh</b><br>

Sometimes Sun eclipses Saturn when they are sitting in the same house. In such a case, there will be no Pitra Dosh. 

Also, in some kundalis both Sun and Saturn may be favourable (yogkarak). In such cases, even if these two are sitting in the 9th house together, they will not form pitra dosh, i.e. they will not give bad results when their dasha will come.

  <b>Note</b><br>

When Sun is in conjunction with Rahu or Ketu is any house of the kundali, then it’s also considered to be a Grahan Dosh.

## Effects of Pitra Dosh

Pitra Dosh is not a very severe kind of dosh. So, there’s not much to worry about. But we will zot down some of its ill-effects here. 

* A person having pitra dosh finds it hard to grow and find success in life.
* He or she will encounter impediments and setbacks in almost every work they do. 
* Such a person will find it difficult to find peace of mind.
* He or she will constantly have to face money problems, i.e. such a person will face lack of money in his life. 

So, you can imagine the life of a person having this dosh. Though this dosh will not ruin their lives, but he or she will have to struggle a bit more in their life. 


## Remedies of Pitra Dosh

Astrologers do not consider pitra dosh as a big dosh. That’s because it emanates from our ancestors. We all know that our ancestors will never want to cause much harm to us, even if they are angry with us. 

As is the case with Lord Shiv, it’s pretty easy to pacify our ancestors too. Let’s see what all we can do to do so. 

* Respect your elders, love them, fulfil their wishes, talk with them, ask their advice in various matters of the household. Though, with many people age does not always leads to wisdom. But even then, be gentler.
* You may keep fast on the day of new moon (Amavasya), and rather tribute food to your ancestors (bhog). Then distribute that food to everyone. If you can feed food to some needy person, then it would be even better. 
* You may kindle a light lamp (clay diya with oil or ghee) in that portion of the house where you keep your household’s drinking water, especially on the day of new moon (Amavasya). 
* You may also kindle a light lamp (clay diya with oil or ghee) under a pipal tree and then circle around it seven times. This too has to be done on the day of new moon (Amavasya). 
* Last but not the least, pray to your ancestors to guide you and bless you.

  <b>Note</b><br>

Kindly keep in mind that just doing the customs or other solutions in a mechanical way may not be sufficient. You have to do it with heart and become a better person.

Maybe our ancestors want us to do certain tasks, and not just useless customs. You may also pacify them by doing the right thing, through your actions – by becoming a Karmyogi. 

Over last 1000 years, crores of our ancestors have been killed, robbed and violated. But we don’t even talk about that. We have suppressed the pain of our ancestors – it’s kind of a deceit we do. It would be not a surprise, if you find that Bharat suffers from this Pitra Dosh as a whole.

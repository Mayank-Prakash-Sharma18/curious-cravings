The biggest problem that physics is facing for a long time is the non-alignment of classical physics and quantum physics. The conception of gravity is pretty different in Einstein’s general theory of relativity and quantum physics. 

That’s why theoretical physicists have not been able to unify the 4 basic forces of nature – gravity, electro-magnetic force, strong nuclear force and weak nuclear force. Many theories have been proposed as the ideal “Unified Theory of Everything” – a theory that can explain the nature of all the four basic forces of nature and hence all the phenomenon occurring in our universe, e.g. String Theory, Standard Model of Particle Physics, etc. However, none fits the bill perfectly.

However, Veds, which are ancient scriptures of Sanatan Dharma, written by Hindus (people living in Indian sub-continent) have their own “Unified Theory of Everything”. It describes how the universe came into existence, and how it works, and even more. 

In this article, we will shed some light on this Vedic “Theory of Everything”, known as ***Vedic Rashmi Theory***. 

It was proposed by Acharya Agnivrat, after extensive research on Vedas.

## What do Physicists know till now? 

If we keep on breaking everyday material into smaller pieces, then what do you guys think we will find at the end?

Well, that’s what scientists have been doing for over a century. Earlier we used to think that molecules and atoms are the smallest possible parts. But then we came to know that atoms themselves are made up of nucleus (protons and neutrons) and electrons. 

Later on, we even broke protons and neutrons in particle accelerators, and came to know about a lot more elementary particles like quarks, and bosons etc. We will study more about these elementary particles in a separate article on ***Standard Model of particle physics***.

However, scientists have still not found all the elementary particles predicted by the Standard Model of particle physics. They believe that if we can build even larger particle accelerators, and collide atoms and nucleus with even more energy, then we may be able to detect some of these elusive particles. And maybe find out that even these are made up of even smaller particles.

The biggest particle accelerator in the world right now is the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), in Geneva (Switzerland).

## Vedic Rashmi Theory vs String Theory

As per String Theory (which has not yet been proved), these elementary particles are basically formed by various vibrations of strings of infinite length. So, at even deeper level of existence, the elementary particles like quarks cease to exist like a particle, and just exist as strings. 

In fact, there’s a famous saying of Nikola Tesla: "If you wish to understand the Universe, think of energy, frequency and vibration."

Vedic Rashmi Theory also supports this vibrations concept. Rashmi means vibration or vibrating entities. 
But Vedic Rashmi Theory goes much beyond String Theory. As per it, there are even finer levels of existence. The medium in in which the strings vibrate is even finer than those strings. 

Even finer states are (in the order of larger to smaller): 
* Akash Tatva, 
* Manas Tatva, 
* Ahankar Tatva, 
* Mahat Tatva, 
* Prakarti Tatva.

So, as per Rashmi Theory, Prakarti Tatva is the finest form of material. And before our universe came into existence, all the matter was in this state only. 

<div class="toc-mak">

  <b>Note</b><br>

The problem with Big Bang Theory is that it cannot explain what caused the big bang, or what was before the big bang. Though some scientists have proposed that matter existed as a very fine soup before the big bang. This sounds a lot like Prakarti Tatva. Though we cannot prove it right now by using observation, experiment or even maths. So, these hypotheses are still in the realm of theories, not facts. 
</div>

Prakarti state is almost nothingness, it’s infinite vacuum space. However, it is not 'nothing'. It is 'almost nothing'. This state of matter is also called as ***Sushupti State of Matter***, i.e. sleeping state of matter. This is the natural state of matter, and that’s why it’s called Prakarti. 

As per Lord Shiva, and other sages of Bharat, this state is undefined, i.e. Avyakt. It cannot be known completely, because in this state the matter is not displaying most of its properties. These are latent. No logic or technology can help us understand it. 

When the universe was in this state, the temperature was absolute zero, and obviously there was no light. There was no mass and no energy. The four fundamental forces of nature (gravity, electromagnetic force, weak nuclear force, strong nuclear force) that we know were also non-existent. The time was also not in the state as it is now. It was dormant.

  <b>Note</b><br>

As per Big Bang Theory too, space, time, matter and energy came into existence only after the Big Bang, i.e. after the moment of creation of the universe. 
</div>

As per Rashmi theory, the universe came into existence when a supreme consciousness (i.e. God) broke this equilibrium state of matter and caused the very first vibrations, the finest of the vibration or Rashmi, called ***OM Rashmi***. It is the active state of time. 

This led to other forms of vibrations. Then with time the basic properties of the basic Prakarti tatva started getting activated. Matter started getting manifested in various forms. 

Prakarti tatva started converting into Mahat Tatva, and then Ahankar tatva, Manas tatva, and finally into Akash Tatva. Akash tatva is space. 

Once Akash tatva came into existence, many more macro vibrations (Chhand Rashmis) started, like waves on the surface of an ocean. The basic OM Rashmi is inherent in all these rashmis. Gravity also came into existence. 

After that Vayu tatva came into existence, followed by Agni tatva (i.e. basic elementary particles, electromagnetic forces, etc.). 

Then Jal tatva came into existence, i.e. the cosmic cloud of ionic state matter. 

After that the Earth tatva came into existence, i.e. atoms and molecules. That is, all those basic ingredients that make up us and our world – stars, planets, etc. 

<div class="toc-mak">

  <b>Note</b><br>

The concept of mantras is also based on vibrations. Various mantras are supposed to resonate with different natural vibrations of the universe. That’s why, as per Vedic experts, it’s not only necessary to say the right mantras, but also that we say them the right way.  

Now, we are not saying that it works or is effective. But that’s what the whole system of mantras is based on – the concept of vibrations. The most important and the most famous of them being the mantra of ***OM***. 
</div>

As per this theory, God controls the very basic OM Rashmi, the finest of the vibrations of the universe. Everything else happens as a chain reaction. That is, our universe is controlled from the quantum world. The macro, classical world we see is controlled by the micro world. 

At the end of the universe, all the matter will return to its original Prakarti state. That is, almost to nothingness. As per Rashmi Theory, the creation and destruction of the universe is an infinite cycle. Universe gets created and destroyed over and over again. This phenomenon has no beginning and no end.

  <b>Note</b><br>

Vedic Rashmi Theory also tells us about the formation of solar systems. As per this theory, the initial orbits of planets around their stars is not stable. A planet’s orbit gets stable only after around 60 revolutions. 
</div>


## Winding Up

Though neither Rashmi theory, nor String theory has ever been proved. If the basic state of matter, i.e. Prakarti Tatva, is undefined then we may never know its true nature through observation, experiments, or Maths. 

<div class="toc-mak">
  <img src="../../../images/pencil.png">
  <b>Note</b><br>

Do you know that scientists and mathematicians have found out that there’s a limit to Maths and Observations. 

* Through ***Incompleteness theorems***, Kurt Gödel proved that the prevalent mathematical methods were inadequate in discovering all that is true about the natural numbers. You may read more about it in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_G%C3%B6del#Incompleteness_theorem" target="_blank" title="Incompleteness theorems" class="mak-link">this Wikipedia page</a>. 

* Quantum Physicists have stumbled upon a problem while conducting experiments on quantum particles, known as ***Observer Effect***. The result of an experiment may get changed depending on whether it has been observed or not. This has led many physicists to debate and ponder upon the role of consciousness at quantum scale. You may read more about it in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_effect_(physics)" target="_blank" title="Observer Effect" class="mak-link">this Wikipedia page</a>.

Maybe we need to adopt a different methodology in our quest of the absolute truth. Maybe we need to seek the answers within ourselves using meditation, kundalini yog, etc. Rather than looking for these answers outside by breaking matter into ever smaller pieces. 

But till we do that, it will remain a matter of speculation. We should seek all possible paths with an open and rational mind, rather than believe in one or the other blindly.

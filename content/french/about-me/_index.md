## Hello I’m Mragank Shandilya 

I’m an Academician, Blogger, and Digital Marketer  

I have worked in various fields, be it MNCs (corporate), armed forces, PSUs or private sector. I was a software engineer for 3 years, also worked in Indian Air Force as Flight lieutenant; thereafter I had small stint in finance sector too (SBI, Bank of Baroda, and LIC as Deputy Manager).

I also have vast experience with freelancing work and just enjoy the freedom that it allows me. The freedom to work from anywhere and at anytime of my choice. And earn as much I want to and am capable of, without having to wait for annual appraisals. 

Nowadays I work as Academic Head in education field (for competitive examinations like GMAT, GRE, CAT, IAS, SSC, Bank). I love sharing my knowledge and experiences with my students. 

Regards <br>
Mragank Shandilya <br>
